I have come some distance with programming languages in a short span of time..From 11 standard to the end of my third semester.All i knew was C,C++ ,that too without GUI && event programming.Then i decided to got to do things on my own…..

I have come some distance with programming languages in a short span of time..From 11 standard to the end of my third semester.All i knew was C,C++ ,that too without GUI && event programming.Then i decided to got to do things on my own…..

 

Started off with JAVA …Thats the time i got a domain,got introduced to drupal.Then i felt i needed to learn PHP to do wat i wanted to do with drupal..Cant leave Mobile Phone programming aside too,infact thats the reason i chose JAVA,so i decided to learn J2ME too..Accidently i met Python and loved its elegance(not many can push python aside).So I decided to learnt that too.Started off with J2ME,completed it.Then went to PHP learn enough to do what i wanted to do with drupal..Then went to Python and finished it too.

Python is pure elegance..Java is power & professional..This is the time i saw JYTHON that combines the power of the JAVA API with the scripting elegance of python && finally gives out a JAR file .WOW!!.If jython is properly maintained , i am sure its gonna rock the programming world.When i have enough knowledge i would surely contribute to the JYTHON project..So Did a bit of JYTHON too.

Now here i am .Learnt PHP,j2Me,python in like a month and a half…Now am looking forward to putting them into use and developing something really useful..May be like a mash of the three.A web based(PHP) app for the mobile phone(python or j2me) or something like that…Fingers crossed and Hopes High
