Life is soooo beautiful sometimes! But only sometimes.Why not always? Hmmm.There are many answers for this question.But for me the only answer is……Life is soooo beautiful sometimes! But only sometimes.Why not always? Hmmm.There are many answers for this question.But for me the only answer is……EXPECTATIONS.All of us expect something ,either out of ourselves ,or out of life, or worst from people around us.

When we expect something,we take the risk of feeling disappointed.I expected a centum in my 12th standard math,I expected my friends to behave as I expected them to,I expected my iPhone to do so many things,I expected to earn enough money to pay my college pays from the stock market,I expected to gain enough knowledge before 3rd year to build a good product and I expected my College to give me that education,I expected my parents to be understanding always.I have expected so many things in life most of them end up in disappointment.So why even expect anything in life and just live life everyday as it is.Imagine a life without any Expectations.Even more imagine a life where there is no expectations on you.You know just get up in the morning.Just do your work for your food,eat ,enjoy the nature,enjoy life.

There is another life too.Expect a lot from you.Do whatever it takes to get that expectation done.Work Hard .If you expect a luxurios life,then earn enough money ,buy whatever your heart wants,enjoy it.So called AMBITIOUS PEOPLE.

Finally what you want in life is happiness.You have two choices to expect or not to.Either keep it simple or make it a little more tough.But remember finally what you want is happiness.So if you can keep it simple then why not.

I love to keep it simple.Doesnt mean i am not expecting anything out of me.I do expect a lot of things from me.I have something in me called WANT.Both of them are closely related.Expectation is hoping somethin.Want is a desire.I want power.I want Money to be powerful.I want respect.And for all this i need to expect somethin out of me.But i make sure that i dont expect anythin from others or let others expect much out of me.I just want to live life my way , not how others expect me to.

I just wished that i never had any WANTS and i could keep my life very simple.But then i realised eveything late.There are expectations already.So i am looking forward to fulfilling them and satisfying my wants and then lead that simple life that leads to happiness.Because its tough to change the system now!!!
