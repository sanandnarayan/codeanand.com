The struggle to stick to plans is **eternal**. Exercise daily, don’t eat junk, write weekly are simple plans, but require enormous amounts of discipline.

Discipline is a limited resource. Tapping into it daily makes life very strenuous. Hence I was looking for hacks that would allow me to stick to my plan effortlessly. After sometime googling. I realized that fear and greed were more generously available in me. And I could tap them. Like

1. If I don’t walk 50k steps a week -> I loose 5$ #Fear
2. If I complete my 3 main tasks for the week -> I earn 50$ towards buying a ergonomic computer chair :) #Greed

The idea that i could now stick to my plans, really excited me. So i wanted to build a system (robot) that would track me and automatically withdraw / deposit money from my account. In other towards I wanted a robot to pin down my free will to slack.

I landed upon [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/codeanand/), an app that charges my card 5$ every time, i miss my plan. Since then, I have stuck to my plan of 50k steps/week for a month now :) Yaaayyyy !!

I setup a [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) that deposits 15$ towards my goals on [Qapital](https://www.qapital.com/). So every time, i complete a todo on [todoist](https://todoist.com/) i get paid towards my greedy goals (which otherwise i feel guilty to buy, like a herman miller chair)
